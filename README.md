<p>An Unsupervised Graph-based Toolbox for Fraud Detection
</h3>

**Introduction:** 
UGFraud is an unsupervised graph-based fraud detection toolbox that integrates several state-of-the-art graph-based fraud detection algorithms. It can be applied to bipartite graphs (e.g., user-product graph), and it can estimate the suspiciousness of both nodes and edges. The implemented models can be found [here](#implemented-models).

The toolbox incorporates the Markov Random Field (MRF)-based algorithm, dense-block detection-based algorithm, and SVD-based algorithm. For MRF-based algorithms, the users only need the graph structure and the prior suspicious score of the nodes as the input. For other algorithms, the graph structure is the only input.

Meanwhile, we have a [deep graph-based fraud detection toolbox](https://github.com/safe-graph/DGFraud) which implements state-of-the-art graph neural network-based fraud detectors.

We welcome contributions on adding new fraud detectors and extending the features of the toolbox. Some of the planned features are listed in [TODO list](#todo-list). 

If you use the toolbox in your project, please cite the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06069) below and the [algorithms](#implemented-models) you used :

## Installation
You can install UGFraud from `pypi`:

```bash
pip install UGFraud
```

or download and install from `github`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/safe-graph/UGFraud.git
cd UGFraud
python setup.py install
```

### Dataset
The demo data is not the intact data (`rating` and `date` information are missing). The rating information is only used in ZooBP demo. If you need the intact date to play demo, please email [bdscsafegraph@gmail.com](mailto:bdscsafegraph@gmail.com) to download the intact data from [Yelp Spam Review Dataset](http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/yelpchi-dataset/). The `metadata.gz` file in `/UGFraud/Yelp_Data/YelpChi` includes:
- `user_id`: 38063 number of users
- `product_id`: 201 number of products
- `rating`: from 1.0 (low) to 5.0 (high)
- `label`: -1 is not spam, 1 is spam
- `date`: data creation time


## User Guide

### Running the example code
You can find the implemented models in `/UGFraud/Demo/` directory. For example, you can run fBox using:

注意：运行之前要首先运行`demo_pre.py`生成所需的`Yalp_graph_data.json`数据集

```bash
python eval_fBox.py 
```

### Running on your datasets
Check out the `data_to_network_graph` function in `/UGFraud/Demo/demo_pre.py` to convert your data into the [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/tutorial.html#creating-a-graph) graph.

In order to use your own data, you have to provide the following information at least:
* a dict of dict:
```
'user_id':{
        'product_id':
                {
                'label': 1
                }
```
* a dict of prior

You can use `dict_to networkx(graph_dict)` function from `/Utils/helper.py` file to convert your graph_dict into a networkx graph.
For more details, please see `data_to_network_graph.py`.

### The structure of code
The `/UGFraud` repository is organized as follows:
- `Demo/` contains the implemented models and the corresponding example code;
- `Detector/` contains the basic models;
- `Yelp_Data/` contains the necessary dataset files;
- `Utils/` contains the every help functions.
